## Ethics 

In congruence with the requirements for the final project set forth by Professor Hong and our careers in software, our project abides by the [Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics/software-engineering-code) in the following ways:

1.  *2.01. Provide service in their areas of competence, being honest and forthright about any limitations of their experience and education.*. 

2. *2.06. Identify, document, collect evidence and report to the client or the employer promptly if, in their opinion, a project is likely to fail, to prove too expensive, to violate intellectual property law, or otherwise to be problematic.*

3. *3.02. Ensure proper and achievable goals and objectives for any project on which they work or propose.*

4. *3.04. Ensure that they are qualified for any project on which they work or propose to work by an appropriate combination of education and training, and experience.*

5. *3.05. Ensure an appropriate method is used for any project on which they work or propose to work.*


6. *3.08. Ensure that specifications for software on which they work have been well documented, satisfy the usersâ€™ requirements and have the appropriate approvals.*

7. *3.10. Ensure adequate testing, debugging, and review of software and related documents on which they work.*


8. *8.02. Improve their ability to create safe, reliable, and useful quality software at reasonable cost and within a reasonable time.*
